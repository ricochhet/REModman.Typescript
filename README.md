# REModman.Typescript

This is partial-backend re-implementation of the CSharp project version of [REModman](https://github.com/ricochhet/REModman.git).

It was mostly made to work as quick prototyping for design and architecture of the CSharp version, plus a refresher on NodeJS and Typescript. Some features are missing or incomplete.
